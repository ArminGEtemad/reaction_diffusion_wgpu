# Reaction Diffusion WGPU

A GPU-accelerated reaction-diffusion simulator written in Rust using `wgpu` and `wgsl`.

This project is part of an ongoing learning journey into compute shaders, real-time simulations, and graphics programming. The goal is to build a flexible simulation playground, explore visual patterns.

## First Focus

- [ ] Minimal wgpu app with full-screen quad
- [ ] GPU-based Gray-Scott compute shader
- [ ] Ping-pong texture simulation
- [ ] Real-time visualization via fragment shader

When these are done, the focus is going to be interactivity, hotreload and maybe UI.

## Requirements

- Rust
- A GPU that supports WebGPU (Vulkan, Metal, or DX12)

## Screenshots and Gifs

Coming soon!

## Math

The math and everything I do will be explained in [here](docs).
